                <p>Hello my name is Hudson I used to play hockey about 5 or 6 years ago for most of my life. When I was playing I wasn't that great at it so I was in a low division. My whole family came from a hockey background so I just ended up joining and I started to enjoy hockey.</p>

Now I have another dog named <q>Buddy</q> and we are going to get another one on the 28<sup>th</sup>. Her name will be <q>Emma</q>.</p>
